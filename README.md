# Tumor Detection using Machine Learning  
*Machine Learning for Brain and Cognition Project*  
**Author:** OÄŸulcan ULU

---

## Project Overview  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to classify **brain MRI images (images are in .jpg not .nii files)**  into two categories:  
 **Tumor** (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary tumors)  
 **No-Tumor** (Healthy brain scans)  

The goal is to develop a **machine learning model** to detect the presence of tumors in MRI images.

---

## Dataset Information  
 The dataset consists of **2000 MRI images**, evenly split between:  
 **Tumor Images** â†’ Brain scans with tumors.  
 **No-Tumor Images** â†’ Healthy cases.  
 **Note:** The project focuses on binary classification (Tumor vs. No-Tumor), not classifying tumor types.

**Dataset from:**
 Msoud Nickparvar. (2021). Brain Tumor MRI Dataset [Data set]. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/2645886

## Setup & Installation
**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and install the required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python

**Update Dataset Paths:**

TUMOR_PATH = "/path_of_tumor_dataset"

NOTUMOR_PATH = "path_of_nontumor_dataset"
